● A settings view to specify how far the user wouldlike to see results.
```
# What we want you to achieve technical wise
```
1. Your Application must be written in kotlin.
2. Employ proper architectures and patterns as you seefit
3. make your code clean and reusable.
4. Caching the charging spots info in the local db andsyncing it for user experience.
5. Multiple variants for different environments (staging/production) 
(just show how you would handle when there are different environmentsif you don’t actually have now).
6. Use multi module architecture.
7. Add some unit tests.
8. Implement Dependency injection in your code
